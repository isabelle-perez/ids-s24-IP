# Statistical Models

## Introduction

Statistical modeling is a cornerstone of data science, offering tools to
understand complex relationships within data and to make predictions. Python,
with its rich ecosystem for data analysis, features the `statsmodels` packageâ€”
a comprehensive library designed for statistical modeling, tests, and data
exploration. `statsmodels` stands out for its focus on classical statistical
models and compatibility with the Python scientific stack (`numpy`, `scipy`,
`pandas`).

### Installation of `statsmodels`

To start with statistical modeling, ensure `statsmodels` is installed:

Using pip:

```bash
pip install statsmodels
```

### Features of `statsmodels`

Package `statsmodels` offers a comprehensive range of statistical models and
tests, making it a powerful tool for a wide array of data analysis tasks:

- **Linear Regression Models**: Essential for predicting quantitative 
  responses, these models form the backbone of many statistical analysis 
  operations.
  
- **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)**: Expanding upon linear models, GLMs 
  allow for response variables that have error distribution models other than 
  a normal distribution, catering to a broader set of data characteristics.
  
- **Time Series Analysis**: This includes models like ARIMA for analyzing 
  and forecasting time-series data, as well as more complex state space 
  models and seasonal decompositions.
  
- **Nonparametric Methods**: For data that does not fit a standard 
  distribution, `statsmodels` provides tools like kernel density estimation 
  and smoothing techniques.
  
- **Statistical Tests**: A suite of hypothesis testing tools allows users 
  to rigorously evaluate their models and assumptions, including diagnostics 
  for model evaluation.

Integrating `statsmodels` into your data science workflow enriches your 
analytical capabilities, allowing for both exploratory data analysis and 
complex statistical modeling.


## Generalized Linear Models

Generalized Linear Models (GLM) extend the classical linear regression to
accommodate response variables, that follow distributions other than the
normal distribution. GLMs consist of three main components:

+ **Random Component**: This specifies the distribution of the 
response variable $Y$. It is assumed to be from the exponential family of 
distributions, such as Binomial for binary data and Poisson for count data.
+ **Systematic Component**: This consists of the linear predictor, 
a linear combination of unknown parameters and explanatory variables. It 
is denoted as $\eta = X\beta$, where $X$ represents the explanatory 
variables, and $\beta$ represents the coefficients.
+ **Link Function**: The link function, $g$, provides the 
relationship between the linear predictor and the mean of the distribution 
function. For a GLM, the mean of $Y$ is related to the linear predictor 
through the link function as $\mu = g^{-1}(\eta)$.


Generalized Linear Models (GLM) adapt to various data types through the
selection of appropriate link functions and probability distributions. Here,
we outline four special cases of GLM: normal regression, logistic regression,
Poisson regression, and gamma regression.

+ Normal Regression (Linear Regression).
In normal regression, the response variable has a normal distribution. The
identity link function ($g(\mu) = \mu$) is typically used, making this case
equivalent to classical linear regression.
    - **Use Case**: Modeling continuous data where residuals are normally distributed.
    - **Link Function**: Identity ($g(\mu) = \mu$)
    - **Distribution**: Normal
+ Logistic Regression.
Logistic regression is used for binary response variables. It employs the
logit link function to model the probability that an observation falls into
one of two categories.
    - **Use Case**: Binary outcomes (e.g., success/failure).
    - **Link Function**: Logit ($g(\mu) = \log\frac{\mu}{1-\mu}$)
    - **Distribution**: Binomial
+ Poisson Regression.
Poisson regression models count data using the Poisson distribution. It's
ideal for modeling the rate at which events occur.
    - **Use Case**: Count data, such as the number of occurrences of an event.
    - **Link Function**: Log ($g(\mu) = \log(\mu)$)
    - **Distribution**: Poisson
+ Gamma Regression.
Gamma regression is suited for modeling positive continuous variables, 
especially when data are skewed and variance increases with the mean.
    - **Use Case**: Positive continuous outcomes with non-constant variance.
    - **Link Function**: Inverse ($g(\mu) = \frac{1}{\mu}$)
    - **Distribution**: Gamma

Each GLM variant addresses specific types of data and research questions,
enabling precise modeling and inference based on the underlying data
distribution.
